When opening a pull request please consider the following:

 * If your change is useful to Electrum in general, i.e. not FTC specific, then
   consider opening a pull request [upstream](https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum).
   Electrum-FTC follows vanilla Electrum closely and always inherits all its changes.

 * Do *not* open your pull request against the `current_release` branch. We used this
   branch to point to the currently newest release. Instead, open your pull request
   against our dev branch which name is a version string.

 * Please try to create self-contained pull requests consisting of a single logical
   change. We're trying hard to maintain a series of commits that are easy to rebase
   against upcoming upstream releases and have decent commit messages that help to
   have a clear understanding what the differences against upstream are.

 * Pull requests that fail CI tests will rarely receive review and thus will also not
   get merged. If you're having trouble to understand why certain tests fail then
   please actively ask for advice by adding a comment and we will gladly help out as
   good as we can :)
