# Electrum-FTC - Lightweight Feathercoin client [![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/Feathercoin-Foundation/electrum-ftc.svg?branch=3.1.X)](https://travis-ci.org/Feathercoin-Foundation/electrum-ftc)

Electrum-FTC is a fork of the [Bitcoin Electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/) adapted to work with Feathercoin.
All improvements which are not related to Feathercoin itself will be made directly in the
[upstream Electrum repository](https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum).

Relevant changes to the Bitcoin Electrum wallet:

* Works with the Feathercoin specifics (address format, difficulty adjustment, NeoScrypt)
* No support for Trustedcoin 2FA or GreenAddress
* No Android version


## Getting started

### Windows

The Windows builds come in three flavors:

1. *setup* - this will properly install Electrum-FTC on Windows including
   adding icons to the Desktop and Start Menu. The installed exe has the
   fastest startup time of all three flavors. Most users want to use this flavor.

1. *standalone* - this is an exe that does not need any installation. It
   will use the ``%APPDATA%`` folder to store settings and wallet data.

1. *portable* - this is an exe that does not need any installation. It will
   use the folder where the exe is located to store settings and wallet
   data. Therefore, it can be used on an USB pen drive to use Electrum-FTC
   on multiple computers - hence portable. This flavor is most interesting
   for testers who don't want to interfere with their existing installation
   of Electrum-FTC.
